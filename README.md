# Kingdoms 4X Lab

A personal strategy sandbox inspired by fast hex-based 4X games.

This is not a commercial project and not intended as a clone.
It is a systems playground for experimenting with:
- Economy scaling
- Population mechanics
- Building caps
- Tech gating
- AI behavior
- Border expansion rules

---

## Current State

- Hex map rendering
- Tile selection
- Turn counter

---

## Design Philosophy

The goal is tweakability.

All core mechanics should eventually be adjustable:
- Population growth rates
- Star income scaling
- Building costs
- Unit stats
- Tech unlock structure
- AI aggressiveness

The system should allow:
- High-growth mode
- Constrained equilibrium mode
- Long-term stability gameplay

---

## Roadmap

Next systems to add:
1. Cities + borders
2. Star income + population
3. Farms and windmills
4. Units + combat
5. Tech tree
6. Simple AI
7. Diplomacy experiments

---

## Long-Term Goal

Create a fully tweakable, hex-based Kingdom strategy sandbox
that allows experimentation with different economic and military doctrines.
